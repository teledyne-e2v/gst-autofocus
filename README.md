# gst-autofocus
Autofocus gtreamer plugin for OPTIMOM module

# Version 1.3

# About

This plugin implements two autofocus algorithm.

## The naive algorithm

From the lower bound of the pda range the algorithm increase the pda value by a given step.
If the current sharpness calculated is the maximum found so far, it is saved.
When X consecutive images are blurrier the pda is set to 0 and  after waiting around 10ms go to the pda value corresponding to the maximum sharpness found.

This technic can be very precise, however it can be very slow if the target is close to the camera.

## The two pass algorithm
This algorithm has two phases.
In the first one the algorithm cover the entire pda range allowed with a given step.
At the same time the best sharpness values is saved with its corresponding pda value.
The new range for the second pass is on either side of the best sharpness
Then the second phase is like the naive algorithm but it uses the pda range found by the first phase.

This technic, if the step for both phases is well tuned, can achieve similar results to the naive algorithm, but much quicker.

## Weighted mean algorithm

This algorithm take 5 sharpness at 5 different focus and do a weighted mean of their sharpness (in function of the DAC) and try to deduce the best value.

## Gaussian fit

This algorithm takes 14 sharpness at 14 different focus and try to fit a gaussian curve. With the fitted curve, it deduce the best focus.

The following libraries are required for this plugin.
- v4l-utils
- libv4l-dev
- libgstreamer1.0-dev
- libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev
- libgsl-dev
- meson

### Debian based system (Jetson): 

```
sudo apt install v4l-utils libv4l-dev libgstreamer1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev libgsl-dev meson
```

### Yocto based system (IMX): 

Teledyne provide a bbappend file which provides all packages needed :
https://github.com/teledyne-e2v/Yocto-files

##### Note : You can also compile them on your installed distribution but it will take a long time to compile (Do it only if you miss one or two packages)



# Compilation

## Ubuntu (Jetson)
First you must make sure that your device's clock is correctly setup.
Otherwise the compilation will fail.

### Using Meson 

In the **gst-autofocus** folder do:

```
meson build
```
```
ninja -C build
```
```
sudo ninja -C build install
```

## Yocto (IMX)
First you must make sure that your device's clock is correctly setup.
Otherwise the compilation will fail.

In the **gst-autofocus** folder do:

```
meson build
```
```
ninja -C build install
```
# Installation test

To test if the plugin has been correctly install, do:
```
export GST_PLUGIN_PATH=/usr/local/lib/gstreamer-1.0/
gst-inspect-1.0 autofocus
```

If the plugin failed to install the following message will be displayed: "No such element or plugin 'autofocus'"

# Uninstall

	sudo rm /usr/local/lib/gstreamer-1.0/libgstautofocus.*

# Usage

By default the plugin is installed in ```/usr/local/lib/gstreamer-1.0```. 
It is then required to tell gstreamer where to find it with the command:

	export GST_PLUGIN_PATH=/usr/local/lib/gstreamer-1.0/

The plugin can be used in any gstreamer pipeline by adding ```autofocus```, the name of the plugin.

To launch the autofocus, write ```a``` in the terminal then press enter.
To recalibrate the autofocus press ```c``` in the terminal then press enter

## Pipeline examples:
Simple test:

	gst-launch-1.0 v4l2src ! autofocus ! queue ! videoconvert ! queue ! xvimagesink sync=false

Manual control on defined ROI:

	gst-launch-1.0 v4l2src ! autofocus step_small=5 offset=2 continuous=false continuous_update_interval=5 x=860 y=440 width=200 height=100 ! queue ! videoconvert ! queue ! xvimagesink sync=false

Continuous autofocus:

	gst-launch-1.0 v4l2src ! autofocus step_small=5 offset=2 continuous=true continuous_update_interval=5 x=860 y=440 width=200 height=100 ! queue ! videoconvert ! queue ! xvimagesink sync=false
